After installing dataplicity set default use to be pi
You can do this by editing the file: /etc/supervisor/conf.d/tuxtunnel.conf
The content should be something like: 


# Installed by Dataplicity Agent installer
[program:tuxtunnel]
environment=DATAPLICITY_M2M_URL="wss://m2m.dataplicity.com/m2m/",HOME="/home/pi",USER="pi",TERM=xterm-256color
command=/opt/dataplicity/agent/dataplicity --server-url https://api.dataplicity.com/ run
autorestart=true
redirect_stderr=true
user=pi
stdout_logfile=/var/log/dataplicity.log
stderr_logfile=/var/log/dataplicity.log

You may want to change the hostname of the device via raspi-config

Then restart the machine.
